            <h4>Making an Impact That Matters</h4>
            <p>At SJ Global Consulting, our purpose is to make an impact that truly matters — for our clients, our collaborators, and the society we operate in.
               <br />We partner with startups, small, and mid-sized businesses to simplify what often feels complex — whether in global trade, operations, ERP systems, or people policies. Our mission is to build structures that last, enable compliance without chaos, and align strategy with human dignity.
               <br />From streamlining EXIM processes to establishing HR frameworks and workplace policies, we help growing companies stay compliant, efficient, and future-ready.
            </p>
            <ul>We offer expertise in:
                <li>Export-Import (EXIM) operations & documentation</li>
                <li>ERP optimization and operational SOPs</li>
                <li>HR policy setup for startups & MSMEs</li>
                <li>Statutory compliance and onboarding processes</li>
                <li>PoSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) policy drafting, training & committee formation</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                We’re not just consultants — we’re your behind-the-scenes partners, enabling you to focus on building your business while we handle what needs to run smoothly.
                <br />Our size allows us to be agile and personalized, but our experience ensures we stay precise and strategic. Every engagement is grounded in clarity, compliance, and care.
                <br />At SJ Global, we turn structure into strength — and complexity into clarity.
                <br />We are here to help you grow responsibly, operate smartly, and lead with purpose.
